Neural Net and some shape detection for Capstone project

*The neural net model is trained to predict the direction in which the agent(object in the center) will go to reach a goal. 
*The dataset was generated by assigning weights to objects using child psychology studies on value inference.
*Data is labeled left and right. 
*The data was trained on around **5000** train images, and validated on about **1200** validation images. 
*The object recognition is some code I wrote previously while brainstorming. This used openCV and contours to recognize shapes.
